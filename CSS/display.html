<div>Paragraphs are the building blocks of papers. 
    Many students define paragraphs in terms of length:<p class="display">Solapur</p> 
    a paragraph is a group of at least five sentences, 
    a paragraph is half a page long, etc. In reality, though, 
    the unity and coherence of ideas among sentences is what 
    constitutes a paragraph.</div>
