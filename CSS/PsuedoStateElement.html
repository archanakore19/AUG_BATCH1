<p class="f-line" >Paragraphs are the building blocks of papers. 
    Many students define paragraphs in terms of length: a paragraph is a group of at 
    least five sentences, a paragraph is half a page long, etc. In reality, though, the 
    unity and coherence of ideas among sentences is what constitutes a paragraph.
